# My Personal Project

## Project Proposal
This application will allow users to create a set of flash cards. Running the program will display questions one at a
time, and users can choose to display the answer and flag the question at any time. The main users of this application
will be students because they will be able to create flash cards for studying. Users will be able to:
* add *and* delete flash cards
* flag flash cards for future reference

This project is of interest to me because as a student who is always working on finding
helpful study techniques, I have considered but have not yet tried flashcards and other methods that
improve memorization. Thus, this project gives me the opportunity to create a study method that works for me and also
strengthen my programming abilities in the process. I am interested in this project because I believe creating my own
questions will help me even more with remembering how to answer them, and other students may find this project helpful
as well.

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to delete a flash card from the set
* As a user, I want to be able to flag important flash cards and view them separately
