# My Personal Project

## Project Proposal
This application will allow users to create a set of flash cards. Users may create a separate set of "flagged" flash
cards for more important flash cards. However, users can *also* delete flash cards. In addition, users will be able to
view all of their flash cards at once. When prompted to, the program will display questions one at a time, and users can
choose to display the answer at any time. The main users of this application will be students because they will be able
to create flash cards for studying. This project is of interest to me because as a student who is always working on
finding helpful study techniques, I have considered but have not yet tried flashcards and other methods that
improve memorization. Hence, this project gives me the opportunity to create a study method that works for me and also
strengthen my programming abilities in the process. I am interested in this project because I believe creating my own
questions will help me even more with remembering how to answer them, and other students may find this project helpful
as well.

## User Stories
