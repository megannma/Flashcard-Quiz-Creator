# My Personal Project

## Project Proposal
This application will allow users to create a set of questions and answers for the purpose of studying. Users will be
able to input questions and answers. Running the program will display the set of questions, so users can answer them
and receive a score for each question as well as a total score. Students will be the main users of this application as
its main purpose is for studying and reinforcing memorization. Students will be able to:
* add *and* delete questions/answers
* modify existing questions/answers
* view their scores at the end of a user session

This project is of interest to me because as a student who is always working on finding
helpful study techniques, I have considered but have not yet tried flashcards and other methods that
improve memorization. Thus, this project gives me the opportunity to create a study method that works for me and also
strengthen my programming abilities in the process. I am interested in this project because I believe creating my own
questions will help me even more with remembering how to answer them, and other students may find this project helpful
as well.
